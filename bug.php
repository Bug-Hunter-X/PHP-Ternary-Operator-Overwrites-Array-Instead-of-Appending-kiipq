This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to using the ternary operator within a function that returns an array.  If the conditional expression evaluates to false, the array's keys will be overwritten by the function's default return value, rather than appending to the array. 

```php
function myFunction($condition) {
  return $condition ? ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2] : ['c' => 3];
}

$result = myFunction(false);
print_r($result); // Output: Array ( [c] => 3 )

$result = myFunction(true);
print_r($result); // Output: Array ( [a] => 1, [b] => 2 )
```

The problem lies in PHP's behavior with the ternary operator when returning arrays.  If the condition is false, it will not append the new key-value pair to an existing array, but rather override the existing array with a new array completely.

Another variation is to use array_merge.  If the first argument to array_merge is empty, you might unintentionally get an empty array.
